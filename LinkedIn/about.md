# What makes a compelling "About?"

Many students feel intimidated when asked to write a long-form introduction to themselves. The good news, though, is that you've already written one, so now you can use it to fill in the LinkedIn "About." Take a look at this formula:

[Your elevator pitch] + [Your stack] + [A call to action]

As you know, an elevator pitch is a short, persuasive introduction to who you are and your major accomplishmentsâ€”**[and you wrote one at the very beginning of your Microverse journey](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interviewing/use-your-usp-to-craft-the-first-draft-of-your-elevator-pitch.md
)**. Copy/paste your approved elevator pitch into the "About" section, and then add your stack and a call to action. Listing your preferred stack gives recruiters a quick idea of the technologies you've worked with, and the call to action will invite recruiters, hiring managers, and others to contact you.

For an example that follows this formula almost exactly, look below:

If you'd like, you can also add a little more information, such as:

- Testimonials from peers (which you can copy/paste from your LinkedIn recommendations)
- A few major projects you've worked on (which you can copy/paste from GitHub descriptions)
- 1-2 sentences about your hobbies or likes/dislikes.
- A few accomplishments that didn't fit into your elevator pitch

However, all you need in order to create a fantastic About Me is are those three elements: your elevator pitch, your stack, and a short call to action.

Take 10 minutes to write an elevator pitch and general call to action, and then copy/paste your stack into your About section. 

**To edit the About section, click on Add profile section and select Add about from the Core menu options.**
